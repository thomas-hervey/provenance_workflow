# provenance_workflow

This repository houses the sample code for a W3C PROV provenance-encoding workflow for social media posts. 
This project is part of my thesis on locational reference disambiguation. For more details, see the following publications:
- (in press) Using Provenance to Disambiguate Locational References in Social Network Posts
- Hervey, T., and Kuhn, W. Deriving Locational Reference through Implicit Information Retrieval. International
Conference on GIScience Short Paper Proceedings 1, 1 (2016).

The documentation for this repository is being updated. Most of the important details can be found under `/app/` and `/app/encode/`.
